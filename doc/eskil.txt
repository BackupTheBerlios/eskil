         \t  Lines  : When there is a changed block with the same number
         \t           of lines in both right and left files, Eskil
         \t           compares corresponding lines and tries to highlight
         \t           only the part that has been changed.
         \t  Blocks : When the number of lines in a changed block is not
         \t           the same in both files, Eskil tries to find lines
         \t           that look the same and place them abreast. The "small"
         \t           version do not parse big blocks to avoid long runs.

Equal sign\t: Above the vertical scrollbar, a "=" will appear if the files
          \t  are equal. While the external diff executes a "*" is shown
          \t  and is replaced with "=" or "" before the files are displayed
          \t  to give that information early.

<b><ul>Bindings</ul></b>

Up, Down, Page Up and Page Down scrolls main windows.

Escape takes focus out of text windows.

Right mouse button "zooms" a line of text. If the text under the cursor is selected, a menu appears where the selected text can be used for a separate diff.

Ctrl-s starts incremental search. Incremental search is stopped by Escape or Ctrl-g.

Ctrl-f brings up search dialog. F3 is "search again".

Left mouse click on the line number of a diff highlights it.

Right mouse click on the line number of a diff gives a menu where it can be selected for separate diff. This can be used to check a block that has been moved.

<b><ul>Merge Window (Appears in conflict mode, or when selecting Merge)</ul></b>

You can, for each difference, select which version you want to appear in the output file.  The buttons "LR", "L", "R" and "RL" select the lines from the left file, right file or both files.
"Prev" and "Next" buttons moves between differences.
"All L" and "All R" buttons select "L" or "R" for all differences.
"Pure" ...
"Save" saves the merge result to a file.

On the keyboard, Up and Down keys means the same as "Prev" and "Next".  Left and Right keys selects "L" and "R".

When saved it is the contents of the text widget that is saved which means you can hand edit there if you are careful.  E.g. you can't use cursor keys, but you can type text, delete text and copy/paste with mouse assistance.
