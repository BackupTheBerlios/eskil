<b><ul>Command line usage</ul></b>

eskil [options] [file1] [file2]
  [options]              See below.
  [file1],[file2]        Files to be compared
                         If no files are given, the program is
                         started anyway and you can select files
                         from within.
                         If only one file is given, the program
                         looks for version control of the file, and 
                         if found, runs in version control mode.
  Options:

  -nodiff     : Normally, if there are enough information on the
                command line to run diff, Eskil will do so unless
                this option is specified.
  -dir        : Start in directory diff mode. Ignores other args.
  -clip       : Start in clip diff mode. Ignores other args.

  -context <n>: Show only differences, with <n> lines of context.
  -foreach    : Open one diff window per file listed.
  -close      : Close windows with no changes.

  -noparse    : Eskil can perform analysis of changed blocks to
  -line       : improve display. See online help for details.
  -smallblock : The default. Do block analysis on small blocks.
  -block      : Full block analysis. This can be slow if there
                are large change blocks.

  -word       : character or word basis. -char is the default.
