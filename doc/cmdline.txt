eskil [options] [file1] [file2]
  [options]              See below.
  [file1],[file2]        Files to be compared
                         If no files are given, the program is
                         started anyway and you can select files
                         from within.
                         If only one file is given, the program
                         looks for version control of the file, and 
                         if found, runs in version control mode.
  Options:

  -nodiff     : Normally, if there are enough information on the
                command line to run diff, Eskil will do so unless
                this option is specified.
