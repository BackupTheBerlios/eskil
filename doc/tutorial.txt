<b><ul>A little tutorial.</ul></b>

When starting this tutorial, a directory diff window is started
showing some example files.

<b>Line Zoom</b>

Double click on "longline.txt" in any of the file lists to bring
up a diff of that file.

Right click on any line in the diff window to see the "zoom" function.
Close that diff window and return to the directory diff.

<b>Separate Diff</b>

Double click on example.c.

In the file there is a block starting with "case TEXT_CGET" that
apparently has been moved since a similar block can be found further
down in the other side.
Right click over the line numbers belonging to that block in the left
part, and select "Mark for Separate Diff".
Scroll down and right click over the line numbers belonging to the block
in the right part, and select "Separate Diff".
A diff window appears, revealing that there was a small difference
within the moved block.

Close the last diff window.

<b>Changed filename in directory diff</b>

Right click on "namechange1" in Directory Diff's left window.
Select "Mark File" in the menu.
Right click on "namechange2" in Directory Diff's right window.
Select "Compare with..." in the menu.
