<b><ul>A little tutorial.</ul></b>

When starting this tutorial, a directory diff window is started
showing some example files.

<b>Line Zoom</b>

Double click on "longline.txt" in any of the file lists to bring
up a diff of that file.

Right click on any line in the diff window to see the "zoom" function.
Close that diff window and return to the directory diff.

<b>Separate Diff</b>

Double click on example.c.

In the file there is a block starting with "case TEXT_CGET" that
apparently has been moved since a similar block can be found further
down in the other side.
Right click over the line numbers belonging to that block in the left
part, and select "Mark for Separate Diff".
Scroll down and right click over the line numbers belonging to the block
in the right part, and select "Separate Diff".
A diff window appears, revealing that there was a small difference
within the moved block.

Close the last diff window.

<b>Alignment</b>

Return to example.c. Double click in the directory diff if needed.

Another way to achieve the same check as in the Separate Diff above
is to align rows that the first diff do not think belong together.
Scroll to the line "case TEXT_CGET" in the left window and right
click on the line number.  Select "Mark line for alignment".
Scroll down to the line "case TEXT_CGET" in the right window and right
click on the line number.  Select "Align with line xx on other side".

Now those lines are remembered, and you could add more alignment pairs
before you proceed with regenerating the view.
Select menu File->Redo Diff.

To clear the alignment information, select menu Tools->Clear Align.

<b>Changed filename in directory diff</b>

Right click on "namechange1" in Directory Diff's left window.
Select "Mark File" in the menu.
Right click on "namechange2" in Directory Diff's right window.
Select "Compare with..." in the menu.
