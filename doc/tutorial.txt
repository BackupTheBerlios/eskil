<ul>A little tutorial.</ul>

When starting this tutorial, a directory diff window is started
showing some example files.

Double click on "longline.txt" in any of the file lists to bring
up a diff of that file.

Right click on any line in the diff window to see the "zoom" function.
Close that diff window and return to the directory diff.

Double click on example.c.

In the file there is a block starting with "case TEXT_CGET" that
apparantly has been moved since a similar block can be found further
down in the other side.
Right click over the line numbers belonging to that block in the left
part, and select "Mark for Separate Diff".
Scroll down and right click over the line numbers belonging to the block
in the right part, and select "Separate Diff".
A diff window appears, revealing that there was a small difference
within the moved block.
Close the last diff window.
