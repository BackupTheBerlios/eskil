<h3>About Eskil</h3>
The first major application I wrote in Tcl/Tk was this tool (somewhere around
1997).  Writing it is what made me learn and enjoy Tcl. (I already liked Tk
but still found Tcl annoying at the time.)<br>
I have used it a lot during the years and lately it has received enough
polish to grant a public release.
<p>
Pronunciation: The E is short, like in "set", the rest is like "skill".
